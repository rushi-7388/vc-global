# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the V&C Global application to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Security Protection

The application implements a multi-layered security approach:

- **Frontend Security**: Client-side protection and validation
- **Route Security**: Protected routes with authentication checks
- **API Security**: Middleware-based API protection
- **Database Security**: Row-level security policies
- **Session Security**: Secure session management

### 2. Security Components

#### SecurityProvider (`src/components/SecurityProvider.tsx`)
- Monitors user activity and session validity
- Implements device fingerprinting
- Provides security level assessment
- Handles auto-logout on inactivity
- Prevents developer tools access

#### SecureRoute (`src/components/SecureRoute.tsx`)
- Wraps all application routes
- Validates user authentication and permissions
- Shows security warnings for low-security connections
- Provides access denied screens

#### SecurityMiddleware (`src/utils/securityMiddleware.ts`)
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF token management
- Audit logging

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

   - Only your email can access admin features
   - Admin status verified through database lookup
   - Separate admin and public product queries

2. **Session Management**

   - 30-minute inactivity timeout
   - Secure session storage

3. **Permission-Based Access**

   - Password strength requirements
   - Phone number validation
   - URL validation

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Parameterized queries
   - Input sanitization
   - SQL keyword filtering

3. **XSS Protection**
   - HTML entity encoding
   - Content Security Policy
   - Input sanitization

### Rate Limiting & Monitoring

1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - 50 requests per minute for admin operations
   - 100 requests per minute for general operations
   - Automatic blocking after limit exceeded

2. **Activity Monitoring**
   - User activity tracking
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Automatic user blocking after 5 suspicious activities

3. **Audit Logging**
   - All security events logged
   - IP address tracking
   - User agent logging
   - Timestamp recording

### Network Security

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Security warnings for non-HTTPS connections
   - Secure cookie settings
   - HSTS headers

   - Browser fingerprinting
   - Screen resolution tracking
   - Timezone validation

3. **IP Blocking**
   - Automatic IP blocking for suspicious activity
   - Manual IP blocking capability
   - Blocked IP management

## Database Security

### Tables Created

1. **security_audit_log**
   - Stores all security events
   - Tracks user actions and API calls
   - Maintains audit trail

2. **blocked_users**
   - Manages blocked user accounts
   - Supports temporary and permanent blocks
   - Tracks blocking reasons

3. **security_settings**
   - Configurable security parameters
   - Rate limiting settings
   - Session timeout configurations

4. **rate_limits**
   - Tracks API call frequency
   - Manages rate limiting windows
   - Supports per-user limits

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

All security tables have RLS policies:
- Only admins can read security logs
- System can write audit logs
- Admins can manage blocked users
- Admins can modify security settings

## Security Dashboard

### Features

1. **Overview Tab**
   - Security statistics
   - Recent events summary
   - Quick status indicators

2. **Security Events Tab**
   - Detailed event log
   - Event categorization
   - IP address tracking

3. **Blocked Users Tab**
   - Manage blocked accounts
   - Unblock users
   - View blocking reasons

4. **Settings Tab**
   - Security configuration
   - System parameters

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

Execute the security migration in Supabase:

```sql
-- Run the migration file: supabase/migrations/20250621000001-security-tables.sql
```

### 2. Update Application

The security components are already integrated into the application:

- `SecurityProvider` wraps the entire app
- `SecureRoute` protects all routes
- Security middleware protects API calls
- Security dashboard available at `/security`

### 3. Configure Security Settings

Default security settings are automatically created:

```json
{
  "rate_limits": {
    "default_limit": 100,
    "default_window": 60000
  },
  "session_timeout": {
    "inactive_timeout": 1800000
  },
  "security_levels": {
    "low": {"checks": ["basic"]},
    "medium": {"checks": ["basic", "device"]},
    "high": {"checks": ["basic", "device", "network"]}
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use secure API calls**
   ```typescript
   import { secureApiCall } from '@/utils/securityMiddleware';
   
   const result = await secureApiCall(
     async () => { /* your API call */ },
     { requireAuth: true, userId: user?.id }
   );
   ```

2. **Validate all inputs**
   ```typescript
   import { validateData } from '@/utils/securityMiddleware';
   
   if (!validateData.email(email)) {
     throw new Error('Invalid email format');
   }
   ```

3. **Use SecureRoute for all pages**
   ```typescript
   <SecureRoute requireAuth={true} adminOnly={false}>
     <YourComponent />
   </SecureRoute>
   ```

### For Administrators

1. **Monitor Security Dashboard**
   - Check security events regularly
   - Review failed login attempts
   - Monitor suspicious activities

2. **Manage Blocked Users**
   - Review blocked user list
   - Unblock legitimate users
   - Investigate blocking reasons

3. **Review Audit Logs**
   - Monitor API call patterns
   - Check for unusual activity
   - Track security incidents

   - Security alert generation

3. **Session Expired**
   - Automatic logout
   - Session cleanup
